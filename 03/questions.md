# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > | abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism |

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > | export default exports a single thing while an export takes multiple things and exports them in one 'package' |

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > | when you group a bunch of different functions into one component, like putting multiple things in an export class |

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > | if you want to change a value for a variable that you don't actually want changing in the AppState such as just for a specific function, you can create a proxy that has the new value without changing the actual value. |

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > | A class is a kind of blueprint that you can use to make a class, and an instance is something inside of the class |

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > | a value that can ve derived from another stored valie |

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > | The MVC pattern separates all our functions and such to make it easier to expand upon a webpage while also removing certain content from the user so that they can't change things that they shouldn't be able to |

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > | the controller essentially acts as a control center for all of our functions in the service and tells everything when to invoke |

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > | The service handles functions that need to be abstracted away from the user's view |

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > | The model stores things that are going to be shown/displayed to the user such as HTML 'cards' |
