02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> | Basically it means that if you have a class you can access it throughout the entire application and only have to make it once |

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> | Like components but for different groups of code that can then be accessed in multiple places across the application |

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> | It creates an object, but subclasses on that object can still determine what this data looks like/is presented as |

06. What is test driven development?

08. Give two examples of a user story:
