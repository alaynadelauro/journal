# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | Github is basically the online hub of the git, which lets us take our code from the GIT and post it online(which is convenient) |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | make directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | a keyword you can add to a selector to specify something when it's in a specific state |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | Specificity tells us at what level something is at. For instance say you have a box, and within that box is a bag, within which is a package with a rubber ducky or something. If you were feeling particularly rude you could try and pour paint all over that ducky. The least specific way to do this would to be to pour the paint over the ducky, painting everything from the box to the duck. However if you specifically wanted only the duck, then you only apply paint to the duck.
    In coding I could use this to target only specific elements with changes (one line of text needing color changed, etc) instead of just dumping color over the entire document, which would change ALL of the text. |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | if everything is important, then the things you actually want to show up as important might get buried beneath other important things |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgb(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | you define what is being targeted (h1), what you want to do to that element (change the color) and how much or to what do you want that value to be (rgb 225, 210, 33, 75)

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | Good design draws the eye and also makes a website seem more trustworthy to someone browsing it. In the words of a teacher: it makes the website look less like it's going to give you a virus if you keep browsing. |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | Wireframing tells us what we want our website to look like. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | I do think they're worth it because they tell us what we're going for before we spend all our time and energy coding something that we or the people we're building the site for don't want.|

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | A property that puts everything into flex(flexible(?)) display instead of block, which makes it easier to move stuff around the way we want it. |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | height(max and min), width(max and min)  |
