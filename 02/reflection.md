# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Taking notes has been very difficult especially at the start of the week due to the fact that we're told all the wrong answers first. I go through and write all the notes, then afterwards have to go back and amend everything, causing me to miss a lot and to varying levels of success, which I would later discover in the labs.

The morning challenges keep covering things we haven't gone over in class yet, so I find myself staring at the screen with no idea how to do this until I uncomment show solution and then try to figure it out, which inadvertently leads to me copying the solution instead of learning it.
